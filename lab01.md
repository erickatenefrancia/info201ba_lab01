# What I hope to learn in INFO 201
**Ericka Tenefrancia INFO 201 BA** 

I am a senior studying Technology and Global Media, Marketing with a minor in Informatics. As an Informatics minor, I am interested in gaining background and useful skills to *simplify* and *translate* data to easily make use of information to *improve* things like:

- a product
- a company
- *and* even people's lives

Algorithms and systems also fascinates me in how big they play in **technology**. Gaining skills in data science to extract knowledge and insights from these structures is definitely something useful that I want to learn being in this era of relying on technology for so many things. I also want to learn how to design and program things to display data for audience of all ages and all kinds to understand easily. Coding is also my *weakness* so this class will really be helpful, I also have zero experience on Python and only little on Java.
